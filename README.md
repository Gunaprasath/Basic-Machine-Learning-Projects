# Basic-Machine-Learning-Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebooks. Each project demonstrates the application of a different supervised learning algorithm to solve real-world problems. Below is an overview of each project included in this repository:

## 1. Sales Prediction Advertising (Sales Prediction Advertising.ipynb)
### Description:
This project applies linear regression to predict sales based on advertising expenditure data. The model analyzes the relationship between different advertising channels (such as TV, radio, and newspaper) and sales outcomes, providing insights into how marketing budgets can be optimized for better results.

### Key Techniques:

Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis

Linear regression model building

Model evaluation using metrics such as RMSE and RÂ²

Visualization of predictions vs. actual sales

## 2. Sales Prediction (Sales Prediction.ipynb)
### Description:
In this notebook, linear regression is used to forecast sales figures based on historical data. The project demonstrates how to prepare data, train a regression model, and interpret its predictions to support business decision-making.

### Key Techniques:

Data cleaning and feature selection

Linear regression implementation

Performance evaluation and visualization

Insights for business strategy

## 3. Survival of Passenger Prediction (Survival Of Passenger Prediction.ipynb)
### Description:
This project utilizes logistic regression to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset. By analyzing features such as age, gender, and class, the model estimates the probability of survival, showcasing the power of classification algorithms in real-world scenarios.

### Key Techniques:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Logistic regression model training

Model accuracy and ROC-AUC evaluation

Interpretation of model coefficients

## 4. Voice Classification (Voice classification.ipynb)
### Description:
This notebook implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to distinguish between male and female voices based on acoustic features. The project highlights the effectiveness of SVMs in handling classification tasks with complex, high-dimensional data.

### Key Techniques:

Feature extraction and normalization

SVM model training and tuning

Evaluation using accuracy, precision, and recall

Visualization of classification results
