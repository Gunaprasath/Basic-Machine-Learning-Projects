# Basic-Machine-Learning-Projects
This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebooks. Each project demonstrates the application of a different supervised learning algorithm to solve real-world problems. Below is an overview of each project included in this repository:

## 1. Sales Prediction Advertising (Sales Prediction Advertising.ipynb)
This project applies linear regression to predict sales based on advertising expenditure data. The model analyzes the relationship between different advertising channels (such as TV, radio, and newspaper) and sales outcomes, providing insights into how marketing budgets can be optimized for better results.

### Key Techniques:

1. Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis

2. Linear regression model building

3. Model evaluation using metrics such as RMSE and RÂ²

4. Visualization of predictions vs. actual sales

## 2. Sales Prediction (Sales Prediction.ipynb)
In this notebook, linear regression is used to forecast sales figures based on historical data. The project demonstrates how to prepare data, train a regression model, and interpret its predictions to support business decision-making.

### Key Techniques:

1. Data cleaning and feature selection

2. Linear regression implementation

3. Performance evaluation and visualization

4. Insights for business strategy

## 3. Survival of Passenger Prediction (Survival Of Passenger Prediction.ipynb)
This project utilizes logistic regression to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset. By analyzing features such as age, gender, and class, the model estimates the probability of survival, showcasing the power of classification algorithms in real-world scenarios.

### Key Techniques:

1. Data preprocessing and feature engineering

2. Logistic regression model training

3. Model accuracy and ROC-AUC evaluation

4. Interpretation of model coefficients

## 4. Voice Classification (Voice classification.ipynb)
This notebook implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to distinguish between male and female voices based on acoustic features. The project highlights the effectiveness of SVMs in handling classification tasks with complex, high-dimensional data.

### Key Techniques:

1. Feature extraction and normalization

2. SVM model training and tuning

3. Evaluation using accuracy, precision, and recall

4. Visualization of classification results

## Conclusion
This repository highlights my foundational journey in machine learning through hands-on projects covering regression, classification, and recommendation systems. Each notebook demonstrates practical implementation of core algorithms and reflects my ability to independently build and evaluate data-driven solutions. If you are interested in applying similar models to your data, customizing these solutions for your organization, or collaborating on new machine learning initiatives, I would be happy to connect. I am open to discussions, partnerships, and freelance opportunities to help bring machine learning into your projects.
